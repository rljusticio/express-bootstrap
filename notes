Introduction
- ExpressJS is one of the most popular and widely used web frameworks in the Node.js development zone.
- ExpressJS allows you to handle Routes, Server and I/O stuff very easily.

- ExpressJS provides a smooth transition for legacy websites to use Node.js as their middle layer.
- So, if you have a website running on Apache or Nginx, then without much change in source code you can convert them into super fast ExpressJS website.

Project Setup
- We are going to develop a website using Bootstrap and ExpressJS.
- Express will work as the web server and routing handler
